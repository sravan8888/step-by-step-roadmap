# step-by-step-roadmap
important tools and focused area for 3 years experience real time 

If you have **3 years of experience in AWS DevOps**, your knowledge should reflect a **strong intermediate to advanced level**. You’re expected to be **hands-on**, **confident in automation**, and capable of **handling real-time production environments**. Below is a structured overview of what **tools and knowledge areas** you’re expected to be proficient in:
## 🔧 Core AWS Services (must have deep hands-on experience)
You should know:
1. **EC2** – Launching, securing, troubleshooting, auto-scaling.
2. **VPC** – Subnets, route tables, NACLs, security groups, NAT, IGW.
3. **S3** – Versioning, lifecycle rules, permissions, static hosting.
4. **IAM** – Policies, roles, MFA, least privilege model.
5. **CloudWatch** – Logs, metrics, custom alarms, dashboards.
6. **CloudFormation or Terraform** – Infrastructure as Code (at least one in-depth).
7. **CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy** – Full CI/CD workflows.
   
## ⚙️ DevOps Tools – Real-time Experience Required
### CI/CD Tools
* **Jenkins** – Pipelines (Groovy), integrations with Git, AWS, Docker.
* **GitHub Actions or GitLab CI** – Workflow automation.
* **Bitbucket Pipelines** (if used in your company).
* 
### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
* **Terraform** (most common in companies).
* **AWS CloudFormation** – Secondary, but useful to know.

### Containerization & Orchestration

* **Docker** – Writing Dockerfiles, multi-stage builds, image optimization.
* **Amazon ECS / EKS or Kubernetes** – Real-world cluster experience.

  * Deployments, scaling, services, Ingress, Helm basics.

### Monitoring & Logging

* **CloudWatch**, **Prometheus**, **Grafana** – Real-time alerting and dashboards.
* **ELK Stack** – Logstash, Elasticsearch, Kibana (if used for logs).

### Configuration Management

* **Ansible** – Writing playbooks, roles, inventories, dynamic inventory.
* (Optional: **Chef**, **Puppet** – less used today, but still present in legacy systems.)

### Source Code Management

* **Git** – Branching strategies, merging, conflict resolution.

## 🛡️ Security and Compliance (must know)

* **IAM Best Practices**
* **Secrets Management** – AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault.
* **KMS** – Managing keys and encryption in AWS.

---

## 📦 Miscellaneous But Important

* **Bash / Shell scripting** – For automation and job scripting.
* **Python or Go (Optional)** – If scripting is required beyond shell.
* **Linux administration** – File system, permissions, services, logs.

---

## ✅ Real-Time Skills Expected

* Troubleshooting failed CI/CD pipelines.
* Handling production rollbacks or failures.
* Setting up alerts for CPU, memory, disk usage in EC2 or containers.
* Managing cost using budgets, cost explorer.
* Working with staging, dev, prod environments.
* Performing blue-green or canary deployments.
